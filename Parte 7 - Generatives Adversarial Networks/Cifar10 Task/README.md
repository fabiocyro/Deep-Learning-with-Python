READ THIS BEFORE RUNNING!

The generator and the discriminator have more than 10 layers that gets many concepts from other CNN architectures.

To have good results, you should run for 100 epochs minimum, but EACH EPOCH WILL TAKE 30 MINUTES ON AN i7 PROCESSOR! So run at your own risk and time :)

And this was based only by the cifar10 images, with 32 x 32 pixels, if you do it with bigger images this can goes up to months of training.

These codes are more to inform you on how to build complex GANs and learn how to work with them.
