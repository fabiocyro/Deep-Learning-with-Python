# Deep-Learning-with-Python
Hey, here you can have some examples of creating many different models for Deep Learning. Using python wih tensorflow and keras

Some notes: 

I am brazilian, so most of the variables and comments in the code were made that way, if you don't understand something and/or want to know what a specific comment means and don't want to use translator feel free to contact me. Also suggestions are welcome.

Requirements for running the codes:

Python
Tensorflow
Keras
Numpy
Pandas
Scikit-learn

Some of the models will require different versions (Specially the GANs), so I recommend you to create virtual environments.


Further in the files, additional comments will be there in case something else is required.
